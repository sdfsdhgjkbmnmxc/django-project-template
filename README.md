django-project-template
=======================

Features:
 * deploy script for deployment to debian/ubuntu (with nginx, supervisor, fastcgi) servers via rsync
 * all system configs (cron, logrotate, etc) located in project folder system/ and symlinked after deploy
 * virualenv for developer and production
 * system/requirements.txt for pip and system/debian.txt for debian packages
 * shortcut runserver-dev.sh (with localsettings.py inherited from settings.py)
 * shortcut test-dev.sh for testing (PEP8 checking inside, testsettings.py inherited from localsettings.py)
 * one simple page ("It works!") out of the box (ideal for one-page django expetiments)
 * folders for commands and templatetags
 * .gitignore and .hgignore
 * etc

Usage:
```shell
django-admin.py startproject --template=http://goo.gl/r6sAa -e sh,conf,sql -n base.html <MYAPPNAME>
cd <MYAPPNAME>
find . -name \*.sh -type f -exec chmod +x {} \; && chmod +x src/manage.py && rm README.md
# and now run your project:

Conventions:
 * suffix "-dev" = "for development only"
